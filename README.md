We are thrilled to present our CSE250 project! 🎉
We've developed an Android application using Kotlin, featuring a sleek, modern frontend designed with Jetpack Compose. This app simplifies the process of ordering food in restaurants. We are immensely grateful for the creativity and support from BDApps that made this project a success. 🙌🍽️

Short Description:
From the user's perspective, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the app includes several key features. The app lets users discover restaurants, such as Central Cafeteria, Hall Dining, Staff Canteen, and popular spots like Shobuj Bangla and Mr. Kachchi Ghor, by accessing detailed business profiles. These profiles will display current menus with pricing, and users can scan QR codes to select tables and view menus. The app enables users to create personal profiles, organize menus with high-quality images and descriptions, and provide nutritional information for dishes. Customers can order remotely to avoid wait times, make secure online payments, and designate favorite restaurants for regular updates. Additionally, the app allows users to rate and provide feedback on their dining experiences and share their orders or reviews on social media.
